# Evaluation Screen Example Images

This directory contains example images used for documentation of the evaluation screen interface.

## Files

- `source-example.jpg` - Example source image (original photo)
- `edited-example-a.png` - Example edited image A (Step1X model output)
- `edited-example-b.png` - Example edited image B (FLUX model output)

## Usage

These images are used in documentation to show what the evaluation screen looks like:
- **SOURCE**: Shows the original source image
- **IMAGE A**: Shows one edited version (e.g., from Step1X model)
- **IMAGE B**: Shows another edited version (e.g., from FLUX model)

These example images are tracked in git (unlike the full dataset images which are stored in Firebase Storage).
