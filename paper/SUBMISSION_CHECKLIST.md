## Review Readiness

### Strengths to Highlight
1. **First I2I refusal bias benchmark** (novelty)
2. **Factorial-design rigor** (84 images, complete demographic coverage)
3. **Dual-metric framework** (hard refusal + soft erasure)
4. **Novel SCS metric** (quantifies cultural gatekeeping)
5. **Strong statistical validation** (ANOVA, mixed-effects, human validation)
6. **Policy relevance** (EU AI Act, EO 14110 compliance)
7. **Full reproducibility** (code, data, Docker)

### Anticipated Reviewer Questions
1. **Why only 3 models?** → Budget constraints, but covers 3 major architectures
2. **Why only 1 image per demographic cell?** → Acknowledged in limitations, mitigated by bootstrapping
3. **Single seed (42)?** → Preliminary tests show stable rank ordering (ρ > 0.95)
4. **FairFace 7 races incomplete?** → Acknowledged, Indigenous/multiracial in future work
5. **Causality claims?** → Careful: we demonstrate association, interventional experiments future work

### Rebuttal Preparation Notes
- Emphasize methodological rigor (factorial design, mixed-effects, human validation)
- Highlight policy urgency (models deployed at scale NOW)
- Reference open-source commitment (enables community extensions)
