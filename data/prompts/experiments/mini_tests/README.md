# Mini Tests

Small-scale experiments for rapid prototyping and testing.

## Files

- `mini_test_prompts.json` - Initial small test dataset
- `mini_test_prompts_improved.json` - Enhanced version with better prompts

## Purpose

- Quick iteration during development
- Test new features without full dataset generation
- Validate pipeline components independently
- Benchmark performance improvements

## Characteristics

- Smaller dataset size (200 prompts vs 28K full dataset)
- Faster processing time
- Representative sample of all prompt types
- Used for continuous integration testing
